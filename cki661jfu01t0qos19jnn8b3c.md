Hi! I started learning Python about 6 months ago, and yesterday made my first graphic application, [Hazy](https://github.com/onyxcode/hazy). I was very happy that upon sharing the project on Reddit, it recieved 4 stars including one from [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/pysimplegui) themselves!

I am very curious and would like to know your opinion on what is considered "practical" for an application, and the reason behind it. I would love to build your ideas into apps!

Let me know in the comments!
